### Project One Reflection

# Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

## Artemis Financial is a literally a company that works in the financial field and is specialized in workiing around the plans for saving, insurance and invenstements. Their proposal and goal with us in this project is to provide RESTful API websites that are highly secure from external attacks. My role in in the team is to work on the vulnerability assessments and create mitigation plans for the existing security problems and vulnerabities in the system. 


# What did you do particularly well in identifying their software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a companyâ€™s overall wellbeing?

## I suppose that I did pretty fine in finding existing vulnerabilities in the Artemis Financial system and identifying the code. Thereafter, I worked on finding solutions to mitigate the found vulnerabilities in the application. 

# What about the process of working through the vulnerability assessment did you find challenging or helpful?

## The dependency report generated a quite large number of vulnerabilities and it was a definitely most challenging part to understand the descriptions of each vulnerability. 

# How did you approach the need to increase layers of security? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques?

## I took several approaches to ensure the security of the applications. The first thing I did was to making sure I am using the most updated version of the software. Also we had an assignment to create our own code to generate hashing algorithms. Having encryption like that can greatly enchance the security of applications. 



# How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

## The way I made sure that the application is functional and secure was not solely limited to testing the funcioanility but also running a dependency check afterwards. 


# What resources, tools, or coding practices did you employ that you might find helpful in future assignments or tasks?

## Most certainly, utilizing the dependency check tool can help identifying vulnerability issues or concerns and how to mitigate such issues. 

# Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to demonstrate your skills, knowledge, and experience. What from this particular assignment might you want to showcase to a future employer?

## I feel like I've done quite a bit of high quality assignments through this course. Showing the code that I've implemented hashing and explaining what it does, and what is it meant to implement encryption algorithm, its history at high level and why it is so important could potentially impress the future employers.
